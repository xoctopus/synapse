# Package syn (Synapse)

`synapse` provides a high-level abstraction for structured concurrency and goroutine lifecycle management.

The core component, **Synapse**, acts as a controlled container for asynchronous workers. It ensures that all spawned goroutines are properly tracked via a `sync.WaitGroup` and responsive to a unified lifecycle boundary, facilitating graceful shutdowns.

## Key Features

* **Wrapping context**: Separates the **Parent context** (metadata/inherited signals) from the **Dispatched context** (internal lifecycle control).
* **Go 1.24 Integration**: Leverages `sync.WaitGroup.Go` for automatic task tracking and standardized **panic propagation**.
* **Shutdown Orchestration**: Provides a thread-safe `Cancel` mechanism with optional timeout protection to prevent blocking the main process indefinitely.

## Usage Example

```go
s := syn.NewSynapse(ctx,
    syn.WithCancelCause(errors.New("service stopped")),
    syn.WithShutdownTimeout(5 * time.Second),
)

// Spawn a managed worker
s.Spawn(func(ctx context.Context) {
    // Worker automatically tracked by WaitGroup
    doWork(ctx)
})

// Gracefully stop all workers and wait for completion
if err := s.Cancel(nil); err != nil {
    log.Printf("Shutdown failed: %v", err)
}
```
